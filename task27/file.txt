Let me introduce myself. My name is Mariya I am a 20-year-old student from Donetsk.
I study at the university in my native town and my future profession is bookkeeping.

We are very much alike: open-hearted, smart and merry. That's why we have a lot of friends.
I like organizing parties for our friends.

In the evening, I often watch TV with my family and discuss my plans for the next day.
On weekends, I often meet my friends or stay at home and read books.
